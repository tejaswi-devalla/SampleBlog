Algorithmic Problem:

def is_palindrome(string):

    new_string = ''
    for char in string:
      if char.isalnum():
        new_string += char
    #print(new_string)
    return new_string == new_string[::-1]

string = input()
result = is_palindrome(string)
print(result) 

Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases: Use tables with predefined columns. Good for complex stuff like finances, best for transactions. Examples: mySQL, postgreSQL , etc.
NoSQL Databases:Don't need a fixed structure, good for flexible data. Good for big data and less-structured info. Examples: MongoDB, etc.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):

Definition: CORS is like a security thing that stops websites from talking to each other too much i.e., stops one domain from making requests to another domain.
How it works: When a web application makes a cross-origin HTTP request the browser sends an HTTP request to the target domain with an origin header indicating the origin of the requesting page.
The server at the target domain can include specific HTTP headers in its response to indicate whether it allows the request.
Handling CORS issues: Configure the server to include appropriate CORS headers.

Coding Best Practices:

Meaningful Variable Names: Use names that make sense. Don't just use letters. If it's counting something, maybe call it count instead of c.
Modular and Readable Code: Break your big problems into smaller ones. Make your code so someone new can read it and not get too confused.
Error Handling: Try to catch mistakes before they break everything.
